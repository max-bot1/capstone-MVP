Pitch:
A website that allows you to search for MTG cards and put them together into a deck and can show you statistics from the deck and prices of the cards. 
I would also want it to be able to export the deck as a txt file.

MVP:
Users can create an account and login
Users can search for cards( and filter their search based on card characteristics)
Users can create a deck (includes cards, name of deck, description etc.)
Users can add cards to their deck
Users can see the decks of other users
Users can see images of the cards

Future Features:
Ability to export decks as a txt file.
Users can see statistics on their deck or the decks of other users
users can comment on the decks of other users
